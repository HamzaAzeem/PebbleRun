PebbleRun
=========

Go out for a navigated run with you, your Pebble, and without your phone.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
One can set a pre-determined route for a run or bike-ride on the PebbleRun web-app prior to leaving.
The app generates a JSON Object containing detailed directions to their destination with the help of Google Maps Javascript API v3.
The Pebble needs to parse the object, store it in memory and track the distance covered with the built-in pedometer.

The aim for this app was to implement:

- Timer
- Turn-by-turn navigation
- Fitness information (e.g. calories burned)
- Nearby restaurants/food shops near the end of the run as a reward
- Vibration feature to indicate to the user to turn left or right
